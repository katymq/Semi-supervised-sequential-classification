Markov models for  Semi-supervised-sequential classification 

Triplet Markov chains are general generative models for sequential data that take into account three kinds of random variables: (noisy) observations, their associated discrete labels, and latent variables which aim at strengthening the distribution of the observations and their associated labels. However, in practice, we do not have at our disposal all the labels associated with the observations to estimate the parameters of such models. In this paper, we propose a general framework based on a variational Bayesian inference to train parameterized triplet Markov chain models in a semi-supervised context. The generality of our approach enables us to derive semisupervised algorithms for a variety of generative models for sequential Bayesian classification.
